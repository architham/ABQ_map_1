ABQ_map_1
=========

Intitial iteration of the ABQ data use application

This version uses the googlemaps api to render the ABQ city data sets.

The following data sets are used:
parks
public art
open space
bike paths
city limits
transit routes

The layers are added to the map using the setMap method in the map javascript file at:
/apps/assets/javascript/map.js.erb

Presently, the layers are controlled by commenting out the setMap methods to turn them off.
